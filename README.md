# React Native Async State Access Bug

This repository demonstrates a common yet subtle bug in React Native applications: accessing state variables before they have been fully initialized due to asynchronous operations.  The `Bug.js` file showcases the problematic code, while `BugSolution.js` provides a robust solution.

**Problem:** Asynchronous operations, such as fetching data from an API, often take time.  If you attempt to access state variables updated by these operations before they complete, you'll encounter errors or see unexpected behavior. This repository highlights this situation.

**Solution:** Employing asynchronous state updates along with checking for the state's existence before accessing its value will help resolve this problem.  The example illustrates this through `useState` and conditional rendering.
